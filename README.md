# FX – Safe Haven Currencies

## About this Repo:
This repository is for the HSG course "Economics in Practice". We were tasked with writing an 8-page report and presenting our results on the Swiss Franc's behavior as a safe haven currency for the Head of Analysis of FX and Gold at the SNB. To this end, we employed a Gaussian Mixture Model to classify periods into crisis and non-crisis periods. After the course we prepared a 1.5 hour workshop for the SNB team.

## Repository Structure:
